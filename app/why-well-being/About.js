<p className="thin h-text">We strive to make well-being a reality for first-mile workers. We have over 20 years of collective experience strengthening ecosystems to protect workers’ rights, promote & improve their health, safety, security, entitlements and living conditions to create inclusive workplaces & enabling environments.</p>
<p className="thin h-text">Through various solutions, methodologies and evidence, we build, promote and facilitate long-term intervention models. We work on systems, policies and behaviours in order to increase scale, impact and sustainability.</p>
<h2>Why Do We Practise Workforce Well-Being?</h2>              
<p className="thin h-text">First-mile workers are highly vulnerable to poverty, exploitation, illness and have little or no incentive to invest in their development. They are at the bottom end of the power and social structures, with poor response systems, services, voice and agency, unable to realise their rights, entitlements and potential. To become resilient, workforces and their ecosystems require interventions, solutions and efforts to address such challenges.</p>
<p className="thin h-text">Our core values and principles encompass the belief that business and human rights can co-exist, ensuring an improved & balanced approach, but not at the cost of each other. We believe that no single entity, solution, or agency is adequate, and that collaboration, joint-investment and partnership can enable significant results. We are deeply committed to the well-being of workers, their families and communities, and we do so by staying true to fundamental principles such as community-centric, accountability, sustainability, trust, transparency, ethical behaviour, respect, fairness, dignity, inclusivity, equity and equality.</p>
