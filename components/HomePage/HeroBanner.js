Millions of front line workers contribute immense value to our society, economy and planet. They keep our farms, factories, markets and businesses steady and growing. However, they themselves live a hand-to-mouth existence, with poor & unsafe working and living conditions, with fragile financial security and an inefficient ecosystem in which they exist and operate. We believe this must change and we will change itâ€”with you and them.
